# Circley Frontend

This project now uses esbuild to bundle the React prototype so `npm run build` produces production assets without Vite.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies, build the bundle, then serve `dist/`:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run start    # builds again and runs `serve dist`
```

If you just want to preview the latest build without rebuilding:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Project Structure

The bundle command puts everything you need inside `dist/`:

* `index.html` – Copied from the root and links the bundled assets.
* `bundle.js` – Generated by esbuild from `src/main.jsx`.
* `*.css` – Copied from `src/` so styles remain available.
